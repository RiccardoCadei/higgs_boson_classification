TO DO:

1. Preprocess the data (Riccardo)

2. Cross Validation (Raphael)

3. Understand why our Logistic Regression  is so RAM consuming (Raphael)

4. Add all function that we need for the 6 methods clearly in the methods.py file (Shasha).OSSERVATION: I don't know why but some functions, like logistic regression, work with dataset used during the lecture of the last year, but they don't work with our huge dataset (what does our Computer Scientist think about this?)
